3dfm
----

Simple install instructions:

       tar -xvzf 3dfm-1.0.tar.gz
       cd 3dfm-1.0
       ./configure
       make
       make install

The last step should be done as root.

If you have any problems, we're sorry, but we made an installer at the
last minute.  This was our senior design project, give us a break.
